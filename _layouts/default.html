            <p align="justify"> My name is Jhonatas Rodrigues. I'm graduated in Computer Science. Now, I am looking for
                my first full-time job. I have been working as a freelance web and mobile developer for the last five
                years and cooperated with several startups even big open-source companies like Mozilla (Firefox for iOS
                and Firefox Lockwise). I cannot say with a hundred percent confidence where I see myself in five years
                or what my big career goal is. The world is changing rapidly, and I donâ€™t have enough professional
                experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an
                extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am
                open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and
                talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
            </p><br>

            <p align="justify">I have a great experience as a Community Team Leader at Mozilla Brazil. At least 6 years as
                a core contributor doing great things to help the Mozilla Community grow up around the world by
                developing tools that help improve the contributions. Also working as a translator, editor, reviewer of
                articles and support directly in the social networks of Firefox accounts too.
