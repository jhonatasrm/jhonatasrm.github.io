				<p class="justify-content"> Hi there! </p>
				<p class="justify-content"> My name is Jhonatas Rodrigues Machado. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I am currently working full-time as a Software Developer on the Oracle Commerce Cloud platform at  <a href="https://compass.uol" target="_blank">Compass.UOL</a>, where I lead projects with clients that have a national and global reach in their respective markets. Some of the projects that I had the opportunity to participate in are:

				</ul>
        		<p class="justify-content">Before starting to work at <a href="https://compass.uol" target="_blank">Compass.UOL</a>, I was a freelance developer on web and mobile technologies, as well as a developer of Add-ons for the Firefox browser. I also had the opportunity to develop in several startups and large open-source corporations on products such as Firefox for iOS and Firefox Lockwise.</p>
				<p class="justify-content">For the next years, I want to be a great and essential team player at the company where I work, always looking for the growth of the company and myself. In the future, I want to have the opportunity to lead an innovative team while seeking an extraordinary approach to every single project. As a part of a team, I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback from my teammates and clients.</p>
				<p class="justify-content">
					Since 2014, I have been a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community#Core_Contributor">Core Contributor</a> at Mozilla. When possible, I strengthen the community by developing tools to help volunteers and staff in their contributions, like the Add-on SUMO Live Helper. During all these years, I have been contributing to Mozilla with functions of leadership, localization, administration of the community website, support, and development (Add-ons for Firefox and apps for Android and iOS). Over these years, I had the opportunity to meet collaborators from different countries at various events, in places like Hawaii, San Francisco, Orlando, Berlin, Vancouver, and Whistler.
