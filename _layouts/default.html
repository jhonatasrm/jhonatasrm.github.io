            <p align="justify"> Hello! My name is Jhonatas Rodrigues. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I
                am currently looking for a full-time position in the software industry. I have been working as a
                freelance developer on web and mobile technologies for the last five years, and I’ve interacted with
                several startups and large open-source corporations like Mozilla on Firefox for iOS and Firefox
                Lockwise. My plans for the next five years include working with an organization that prides itself on
                caring for employees, users, digital privacy, and security. In the future, I would like to lead a team
                that embraces those values as well.
                If I am successfully hired to be part of your team, I can provide an open-minded, fresh take, and an
                extraordinary approach to every project. Additionally, I am always open to challenges and constructive
                feedback. After working with multiple organizations, my teammates recognize me as a fast learner and
                reliable team player, where I dedicate my time and experience to develop high-quality and unique
                products.
            </p><br>

            <p align="justify">I am presently a Community Team Leader at Mozilla Brazil and have been a core contributor
                since 2014. I
                continue to strengthen Mozilla’s community by developing tools to improve volunteer and staff
                contributions. Moreover, I am a translator, editor, and reviewer of knowledge base articles, and I
                provide social media support through official Firefox channels (Twitter and Google Play).
            </p><br>

            <p align="justify">Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. If you believe I will be a great addition to
                your organization, please feel free to reach out to me.
            </p>
