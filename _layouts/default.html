				<p class="justify-content"> Hi there! </p>
				<p class="justify-content"> My name is Jhonatas Rodrigues Machado. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am currently working full-time as an Oracle CX Commerce Developer at <a href="https://compass.uol" target="_blank">Compass.uol</a>, working with companies with a global reach in the market. I'm very proud to be part of that fantastic company that has big clients in Brazil and the world. Before starting to work at <a href="https://compass.uol" target="_blank">Compass.uol</a>, I was a freelance developer on web and mobile technologies, as well as a developer of Add-ons for the Firefox browser. I also had the opportunity to develop in several startups and large open-source corporations on products such as Firefox for iOS and Firefox Lockwise. </p>
				<p class="justify-content"> For the next years, I want to be a great and essential team player at <a href="https://compass.uol" target="_blank">Compass.uol</a>, always looking for the growth of the company and me as well. In the future, I want to have the opportunity to lead an innovative team while seeking an extraordinary approach to every single project. As a part of an excellent team, I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback from my teammates. </p><br>
				<p class="justify-content">I was a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community#Core_Contributor">Core Contributor</a> at Mozilla (2014 - 2020) and also a Community Leader at Mozilla Brazil. When possible, I strengthen the community by developing tools to improve volunteer and staff contributions like <a href="https://github.com/mozillabrasil/sumo_live_helper">SUMO Live Helper</a>. During these years I contributed to Mozilla with the roles of leadership, localization, administration, and development (Firefox add-ons and apps for Android and iOS). </p><br>
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better.
